# The Hacking Project - Database of Blog


## :mag: The content
In these exercises, I had to design a **database for factories**, where:
* There is an assembly model, which would be the assembly of several parts
* A part can belong to several assemblies. 

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd thp_make-db-factory
$ bundle install
```

You can also generate random data in the database by doing :
```sh
$ rails db:seed
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.
